# Geopolitical-Dynamics-and-India-s-Strategic-Position

Project Title: **Geopolitical Dynamics and India's Strategic Position**

## Database Implementation

This project now supports both MongoDB and MySQL databases with a focus on practical data management.

### MySQL Setup and Creator-based Filtering

The application uses Sequelize ORM to manage MySQL database operations:

1. **User Model**: Stores user information including username and email
2. **Item Model**: Stores strategic entities with a text-based `created_by` field for flexible creator attribution

#### Setup Instructions:

1. Configure your MySQL connection in `.env`:
   ```
   MYSQL_HOST=localhost
   MYSQL_USER=root
   MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_password
   MYSQL_DATABASE=geopolitical_db
   MYSQL_PORT=3306
   ```

2. Initialize and seed the MySQL database:
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies 
   cd backend
   npm install
   
   # Initialize MySQL with sample data
   npm run init-mysql
   
   # Or initialize both databases
   npm run init-all
   ```

3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### New API Endpoints

- `GET /api/creators` - Fetch all unique creator names from existing items
- `GET /api/items?created_by=:creatorName` - Fetch items created by a specific creator
- `POST /api/items` - Create a new item with creator attribution

### UI Enhancements

The frontend now includes:
- Text input field for entering creator name when creating new entities
- Dropdown for filtering entities by existing creator names
- Entity display showing the creator's name

### Project Overview:
The aim of this project is to investigate how global geopolitics, including major powers' actions and regional tensions, impact Indian foreign policy, economy, and security. The idea is to have an interactive platform that gives insights on various geopolitical events, their consequences for India, and strategic decisions India has made in response to these developments. The project will look at current geopolitical trends in the US-China rivalry, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and Indo-Pacific security issues, and delve into their particular influence on India.

### Key Features:
1. **Interactive Geopolitical Map**:
• A map showing key geopolitical hotspots around the globe (e.g., Indo-Pacific region, Russia-Ukraine conflict, Middle East tensions).
- Highlight how these regions impact India's security, trade, and foreign policy decisions.

2. **Timeline of Major Events**
• A timeline feature that highlights important geopolitical events and their direct or indirect consequences for India (for example, trade wars, military alliances, or sanctions).

~~3. **India’s Foreign Policy Analysis**:
- Section on India's responses to geopolitical challenges, including alliances (such as Quad, BRICS), defense strategies, and diplomatic engagements.
• Detailed case studies of India's foreign policy decisions and outcomes.

4. **Real-Time Geopolitical News Feed**:
- Integration of an API to provide real-time news related to geopolitics and India's interactions with the global community.
- Articles, reports, and analyses will be summarized to give a holistic view.

5. **India’s Economic Impact**:
• Data visualizations (graphs, charts) on how global geopolitical events impact India's economy (e.g., fluctuations in oil prices, trade disruptions, foreign investments).
- Analysis of sectors such as defense, energy, and trade.

6. **Diplomatic Sentiment Analysis**:
- Sentiment analysis of social media platforms like Twitter and news articles to analyze public opinion in real time about the foreign policy decisions taken by India.

### Tech Stack:
#### Frontend:
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Basic website structure and interactivity.
- **React.js**: For creating dynamic and responsive components, particularly for the interactive map and real-time news feed.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For fast, responsive design.

#### Backend:
- **Node.js** with **Express**: To handle API requests, manage the backend, and serve content to the frontend.
- **MongoDB**: To store data like case studies, user feedback, and event timelines.
- **Geopolitical APIs (e.g., News API, Geonames)**: Real-time news feeds and location data.

#### Hosting:
- **Netlify** or **Vercel** for frontend deployment.
- **Heroku** or **AWS** for backend deployment and API management.
#### Data Visualization:
- **Plotly** or **Chart.js**: For visualizing economic data, trends, and geopolitical shifts.

### Why This Project:
I have chosen this project because geopolitics affects national security, economic stability, and global positioning in a very big way. In this scenario, the strategic location of India and the increasing influence in the world stage place it at a critical position in the international geopolitical scenario. Understanding how geopolitical trends affect India is crucial for future policymakers, analysts, and citizens alike.

This project will be useful for all those wanting to understand the confluence of international relations and national policy, particularly as India charts its course through an increasingly complex world.......

By working on this project, I will:
- Deepen my understanding of global politics, foreign policy, and international relations, especially as they pertain to India.
- Technical skills in data visualization, real-time news aggregation, and sentiment analysis.
• Gain practical experience with front-end and back-end web development using modern technologies like React, Node.js, and Python.
- Create a forum that can act as an educational tool for those interested in India's foreign relations and strategic decisions.

Ultimately, this project will not only strengthen my coding skills but also provide a better understanding of the critical geopolitical factors shaping India's role on the global stage.
